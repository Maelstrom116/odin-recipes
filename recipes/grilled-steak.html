<p>I don't know what it is, but the steaks from Costco, and the right seasoning are just perfection. Nothing tastes better than this when you're in the mood for a good steak.</p>

<p>I've been cooking this one for about 8 or 10 years. I've never deviated because there is no reason that anyone could say that would make me change my mind. This is the best. Steak houses don't hold a candle to this, <strong>just you wait.</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Costco Sirloin Steak</li>
    <li>McCormicks Montreal Steak Seasoning</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Heat the grill</li>
    <li>Season steak, preferably 24 hours</li>
    <li>Have steaks at room temperature, usually 20 minutes out of fridge</li>
    <li>Cook the steaks to your desired temperature. Anything over Medium is the devil's work.</li>
    <li><strong><em>ENJOY!</em></strong></li>
